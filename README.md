## Background / Motivation

While building the [***Faster***](https://github.com/ideaq/faster)
module we decided to use [**Child Process**](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html)(es)
to run the application we are observing.  
As a result, we need to be able to kill those processes in order to re-start the app.  
**Terminate** seemed like the *best* (of the available) name,
if you have a better suggestion, please share!
